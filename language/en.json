I hold a Bsc in Geography from MÃ¼nster University, am a Msc student in Geographical Information Management & Applications (<a class='textlink' href='https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/geographical-information-management-and-applications-gima'>GIMA</a>), and I'm passionate about everything around GIS. I have experience in ArcGIS and QGIS desktop environments, the Python geospatial stack (Geopandas, libpysal, shapely, folium, pyproj, as well as the usual data science libraries), spatial databases (specifically PostGIS), as well as R and web mapping. If you want to know more, check out my CV.",
